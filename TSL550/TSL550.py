        Conduct a sweep between two wavelengths. This method goes from
        the start wavelength to the stop wavelength (units:
        manometres). The sweep is then repeated the number of times
        set in the number parameter.

        If delay (units: seconds) is specified, there is a pause of
        that duration between each sweep.

        If the parameter continuous is False, then the sweep will be
        conducted in steps of fixed size as set by the step_size
        parameter (units: nanometres).

        In continuous mode, the duration is interpreted as the time
        for one sweep. In stepwise mode, it is used as the dwell time
        for each step. In both cases it has units of seconds and
        should be specified in 100 microsecond intervals.

        If the twoway parameter is True then one sweep is considered
        to be going from the start wavelength to the stop wavelength
        and then back to the start; if it is False then one sweep
        consists only of going from the start to the top, and the
        laser will simply jump back to the start wavelength at the
        start of the next sweep.

        If the trigger parameter is False then the sweep will execute
        immediately. If it is true, the laser will wait for an
        external trigger before starting.
